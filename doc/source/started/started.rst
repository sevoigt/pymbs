Getting Started
===============

This section is meant to be a quick start guide and shall provide an overview
of the basic features and capabilities of the PyMbs module. For a more detailed
description please consult the :ref:`reference`.

What is PyMbs?
--------------

PyMbs is a tool to generate the equations of motion of holonomic multibody
systems. The equations can be exported to several target languages like Matlab,
Modelica, Python or C++. Thus the output of PyMbs is a mathematical model of
the mechanical system which can be simulated by timestep integration.

The description of the mechanical system is text-based but held as easy and
convenient as possible. The user assembles the system from a range of
predefined objects like bodies, joints, loops and sensors. As this method
may provoke typing errors, especially when modelling more complex systems,
it is possible to create a visualisation for the mechanical system
from CAD files or geometric primitives to check the consistency of the model.
It is also possible to manipulate the degrees of freedom interactively.

Installation
------------

It was tested on Python 2.7. In this section the required modules are specified
and afterwards a step-by-step instruction is given on how to install PyMbs on
Windows machines, which is intended to help users who never got in touch with
Python before.

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* numpy
* scipy
* VTK
* matplotlib
* Qt5

Windows
^^^^^^^

This guide assumes that no Python distribution is installed on your system. If
Python is already installed, you may go directly to :ref:`sec-first-example`.
We strongly recommend the installation of a prebundled Python distribution to
avoid troubles regarding dependencies.

* Download Python(x,y) from http://www.pythonxy.com.
* Install Python(x,y). Make sure you selected *'Full'* as *'type of
  install'*. This will install Python 2.7
  to *'C:\\Python27'* and Python(x,y) to *'C:\\Program Files\\pythonxy'* per
  default.

	   Python(x,y) installer

* Install PyMbs using the installer `PyMbs-0.2.1-alpha.win32.exe <https://bitbucket.org/pymbs/pymbs/downloads/PyMbs-0.2.1-alpha.win32.exe>`_.

  Note that this programme must be run with administrator privileges. Please
  make sure that PyMbs uses the correct Python Version which is in
  *'C:\\Python27'* per default. This is especially important if there is more
  than one Python distribution installed.

* You may use any text editor to write your PyMbs models. However, we recommend
  the use of PyScripter as it supports syntax highlighting and code completion.
  It is freely available at `http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/
  <http://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/>`_.

* You can check your installation by starting Python(x,y) from your desktop and
  pressing the button next to IPython(x,y) which will start IPython. As soon
  as IPython has started a line saying ``In [1]:`` will appear. Now type
  ``from PyMbs.Input import *``. If there is no error message and it jumps
  directly to ``In [2]:`` then the installation was successful.

     Check your installation

Linux
^^^^^

Currently, there are no PyMbs binaries for Linux. However, you can build
PyMbs yourself. All you need is a C++ Compiler, CMake and various python
packages, specifically numpy, scipy, matplotlib, vtk and PyQt4. Under
Debian and Ubuntu, you can install these with::

    sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake python-numpy python-scipy python-vtk python-qt4 python-h5py python-matplotlib

Then all you have to do to build and install PyMbs is::

    sudo python setup.py install

Mac OS
^^^^^^

As we don't have a Mac available for testing, we can't give any instructions
for installing. Basically, if you have Python and its modules running, you only
need to copy the PyMbs package to a folder of your choice and add it to the
PYTHONPATH.

A First Example
---------------

Mechanical System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order to demonstrate the usage of PyMbs a simple exemplary system shall be
modeled. Consider the system of a crane crab given in figure
:ref:`fig-crane-visual`.

Model Description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next the model of the Crane Crab is generated using PyMbs.

* Start PyScripter (or your favourite Python editor) and copy the following code into
  the editor window. Please note that some systems mess up the apostrophe '?!
  If that is the case it is marked as red and has to be replaced manually by a proper one.::

		# import PyMbs
		from PyMbs.Input import *

		# set up inertial frame
		world=MbsSystem([0,0,-1])

		# add inputs and parameters
		F=world.addInput('F', limits=[-10, 10], name='DrivingForce')
		m1=world.addParam('m1', 1.0)
		m2=world.addParam('m2', 1.0)
		l2=world.addParam('l2', 1.0)
		I2=world.addParam('I2', (m2*l2**2)/12)

		# add bodies
		crab=world.addBody(mass=m1, name='Crab')
		pend=world.addBody(mass=m2, inertia=diag([0,I2,0]), name='Pendulum')
		pend.addFrame(name='joint' , p=[0, 0, l2])
		pend.addFrame(name='middle', p=[0, 0, l2/2], R=rotMat(pi/2,'x'))

		# add joints
		jT = world.addJoint(world, crab, 'Tx', 1, name='TransCrab')
		jR = world.addJoint(crab, pend.joint, 'Ry', -1, name='RotPendulum')

		# add load element and sensor
		world.addLoad.CmpForce([F,0,0], crab, world)
		world.addSensor.Distance('d', crab, world)

		# add visualisation
		world.addVisualisation.Box(crab, 1, 0.5, 0.1)
		world.addVisualisation.Cylinder(pend.middle, 0.01, 1)
		world.addVisualisation.Sphere(pend, 0.1)

		# generate equations
		world.genEquations.Explicit()

		# generate simulation code
		world.genCode.Python('CraneCrab', './Output')

		# show system
		world.show('CraneCrab')

* Once you have done this, you can run the model by clicking on the button
  with a green arrow inside. After a short moment you should see a screen showing
  the crane crab (figure :ref:`fig-crane-visual`). You may use the sliders on
  the left to move the crane crab and the pendulum which can be used for
  checking the kinematics of your assembly.
  In case you receive a Syntax Error you might have to replace the inverted commas
  by 'proper ones'.
  Also note that, due to the fact that PyScripter does not properly reinitialise its
  Python engine, it might help to restart it as soon as you receive errors you cannot
  explain.

Code Export
^^^^^^^^^^^
Python
""""""
The command ``world.genCode('py', 'CraneCrab')`` is used to export the
equations of motion into Python format. The generated module
*CraneCrab_der_state.py* includes the function *CraneCrab_der_state(t,
y)* which calculates the state derivative from a given state. This can be used in combination with any standard numerical integrator, which is able to solve differential equations of the form

.. math::

   \dot{y} = f(y,t)

where y is the state vector and t the time.

Modelica
""""""""
The Modelica code generator, accessible through ``world.genCode('mo','CraneCrab')``, creates a file called
*CraneCrab_der_state.mo*. It can be used in combination with any Standard
Modelica tool such as OpenModelica (http://www.openmodelica.org) or
JModelica (http://www.jmodelica.org). Note, that this special model is defined partial since no equation for the input F is given. Usually, the driving force F is calculated directly inside Modelica using the Modelica Standard Library (MSL). In order to combine this model with the MSL, it is recommended to write another Modelica model by hand as given in the listing below which inherits from the automatically generated
model and simply extends it by a mechanical connector::

	model CraneCrab
	extends CraneCrab_der_state;
		import Modelica.Mechanics.Translational.*;
		Interfaces.Flange_b flange;
	equation
		flange.f = F;
		flange.s = d[1];
	end CraneCrab;

Matlab
""""""
The MATLAB code generation is more involved since five different files are generated

**CraneCrab_sim.m**
Basic simulation file. It defines the initial values, start time and
stop time and calls the solver.

**CraneCrab_der_state.m**
This file features the calculation of all state derivatives of the form

.. math::

   \dot{y} = f\left(t,y \right)

**CraneCrab\_inputs.m**
This function is called from CraneCrab_der_state.m. Here one can implement its
own algorithms to generate inputs to the system.

**CraneCrab_sensors.m**
PyMbs separates the calculation of sensor values from the state derivatives.
The function within CraneCrab_sensors returns a struct containing all sensor
values if passed a state vector, i.e.

.. math::

   S = g\left(t,y \right)

**CraneCrab_visual.m**
This file can be used to visualise the system according to the description in
the PyMbs model description. It features a function that takes the result from
the MATLAB Solvers, i.e. a vector T containing all time values and a matrix Y
where each row is a state vector. The column corresponds to the time value in
T. There is third parameter fak which can be used to slow the visualisation
down if chosen greater than one.
