We startetd working on PyMbs in July 2009, as we faced the need of a
convenient way to obtain the equations of motion of complex mechanical
systems to feed a real time simulatiuon environment based on the Modelica
modeling language. By the release of PyMbs 0.1 these aim could be achieved.
Nevertheless PyMbs is subject to ongoing development to enhance its features
and increase numeric performance. It is published under the LGPL license.

If you face any problems using PyMbs, feel free to contact us. As Christian's
got a heart for PyMbs users, he will be your primary contact person. Of course
you may consult any other developer as well.
